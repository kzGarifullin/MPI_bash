Title:

Implementation of a ribbon algorithm for matrix multiplication

Objective:

Using MPI technology in python, perform two matrices multiplication using a ribbon scheme, compare with the execution of sequential 
(non-parallelized) code. And also to plot the dependence of running time, acceleration and efficiency depending on the number of processors p and 
matrix size n.
